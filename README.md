### Overview

It's a custom shared catalog of templates for [Generamba](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/Generamba) code generator.

**Generamba** is a code generator made for working with Xcode. Primarily it is designed to generate VIPER modules but it is quite easy to customize it for generation of any other classes (both in Objective-C and Swift).

The detailed information about a template structure is available in [Generamba Wiki](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/Generamba/wiki/Template-Structure).
